**# Phenomenon #1 - New Jersey customers leaving bikes in the city **

Both New Jersey member and casual riders are starting their rides in New Jersey. Many riders return back to New Jersey, while others do not return to New Jersey, or take alternative transportation home. We see this when looking at the start and end side by side maps. You can see both casual and member riders ending their rides in a wide variety of places in New York. This is possibly because there are many more stations and many more sites to see once on the New York side of the river, versus on the New Jersey side of the river. 

**Phenomenon #2 - New Jersey tourists find long summer rides to be enjoyable**

In the summer months there is an increase in casual users due to tourism. Even on the New Jersey side, this is still the case as we see casual riders increase starting in June through September. In October, casual ridership drops off and this pattern continues into the winter months. In addition, in the past 12 months, casual rider duration is twice as long as member riders. This could be because member riders are largely residents of New York and use the bikes as a form of transportation between work and home, and home and other places of business, while many, if not most, casual riders can be inferred to be from outside the city and therefore have more leisure time when visiting.
